# Telegram bot 

I create this bot in telegram for adding extra functionalities in a personal telegram channel. 

## Commands:
    /Meme: A simple command which responses with a meme of Overwatch
    /Counter (Overwatch hero): WIP A command that receives an Overwatch Heroe and reply with the best counter


## Notifications:
    - Conected to server discord channel: When someones connect to an specific channel, it sents a notification to the telegram channel
    - Disconnected from server discord channel: Same notification but the opposite message


# Next Steps:
    - Learn how to use threads to get notifications and commands working at the same time
    - Create a counter command that receives a name and if is valid, replies with a list of Overwatch heroes that are a counter of the selected character
    - Improve the readme with a explanation of how to install and which tokens are required
    - Create a database to store all the meme images
